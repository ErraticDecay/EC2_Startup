# EC2_Startup

Created this repo for personal use / documentation purposes while testing postgresql for work. I'm hoping we can get some use out of it internally even though it's not NW specific, all information is relevant and functions about the same in our AWS env. Any issues let me (Sean G) know on teams or skype, I can provide my pem file to anyone on the team (or b247) if you want to just see what's out there instead of doing your own.

The documents are numbered and except for the first you can do them in any order, I believe, this was just the order I set them up.

***Cost disclaimer** - I leave my instance and not too concerned with cost, but make sure you shutdown your instance or set it up w/ a schedule so you're not charged a silly amount. Bezos needs a new car and would appreciate any contributions.*
